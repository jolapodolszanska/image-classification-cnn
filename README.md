# About project 

 Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN)} is a deep learning algorithm that can take an input image, assign meaning (learnable weights and biases) to different aspects/objects in the image, and be able to distinguish one from another. The preprocessing required in ConvNet is much lower compared to other classification algorithms. While in primitive methods filters are designed manually, with sufficient training ConvNets have the ability to learn these filters/features.

 Project uses the the built-in CIFAR10 dataset, which contains 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images in each class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The classes are mutually exclusive and do not overlap.
